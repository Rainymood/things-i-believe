# Things I Believe

Inspired by [Jan
Stette](https://gist.github.com/stettix/5bb2d99e50fdbbd15dd9622837d14e2b) and
[Wesley Aptekar-Cassels](https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/engineering-beliefs),
I have decided to write down some things that I believe about software,
product, and systems engineering. 

## Fundamentals

Keep it simple, stupid. 

You ain't gonna need it.

You should think about what to do before you do it.

You should try to talk about what you’re planning to do before you do it.

You should think about what you did after you did it.

Be prepared to throw away something you’ve done in order to do something different.

Always look for better ways of doing things.
